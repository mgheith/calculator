Feature: Subtraction
	As a programmer
	I want to make a custom Calculator
	That can properly subtract numbers
	
Scenario: Subtracting 2 integers
	Given I have 2 integers
	When I subtract 2 integers
	Then an integer is returned
	
Scenario: Subtracting with 2 different integers	
	Given I have 2 integers
	When I subtract the 2 integers
	Then the first number is subtracted by the second
	
Scenario: Subtracting with Zero as a number
	Given I have zero as 1 of 2 integers
	When I subtract Zero from the first integer
	Then I will get the integer back
	
Scenario: Subtracting an integer by itself
	Given I have 2 of the same integer
	When I subtract the integers
	Then the subtraction will equal zero
	
Scenario: Subtracting with more than 2 numbers
	Given I have 3 integers
	When I subtract these 3 numbers
	Then it will produce the difference
